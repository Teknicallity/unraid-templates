FolderView lets you create folders for grouping Dockers and VMs together to help with organization. Especially useful if you're using docker-compose.
Getting Started: A new button named "Add Folder" will appear at the bottom of the docker and VM tab(s) next to "Add Container", depending on whether they are enabled in Settings or not.&#xD;

This is VladoPortos's fork from scolcipitato's original (now broken) Folderview plugin. 
He has not yet created an Unraid templates repository, so this serves as a stop-gap until that happens.
If this is against any rules or is otherwise unwanted, feel free to contact me on Github and I will remove it.
